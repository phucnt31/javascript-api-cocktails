## Introduction

- The Cocktail Explorer is an AJAX-based application that utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve and display a variety of cocktails from the CocktailDB API. Users can explore a collection of cocktails, search for specific cocktails, and view detailed information about each cocktail when clicked. This project demonstrates the integration of AJAX, the Fetch API, and the CocktailDB API to create an interactive cocktail exploration experience.
